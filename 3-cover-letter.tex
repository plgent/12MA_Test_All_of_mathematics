\noindent Dear test supervisor:

\vspace{.125in}

\noindent Thanks for supporting student learning at OAC! Please remind students to use a blue or black pen throughout and to draw graphs accurately in pencil. Students should show all their working.

\vspace{.125in}

\noindent Make sure that you both \textbf{write your names} in the space provided on Page~1, to indicate that these exam conditions were satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time limit: \textbf{\MakeLowercase \timelimit}.
    \item Restrictions: \textbf{\MakeLowercase \conditions\ allowed}.
	\item Students shouldn't use the internet.
	\item Students shouldn't discuss their work with anyone.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This page can be removed before you distribute the test to students. Scan and email the completed test back to me by the due date. If the extra space wasn't used, it needn't be returned.
